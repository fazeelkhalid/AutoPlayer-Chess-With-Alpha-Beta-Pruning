# AutoPlayer-Chess-With-Alpha-Beta-Pruning
 Game of chess has been a classic AI problem and these days there are several excellent open source implementations of automatic chess players are available on line. In this assignment we are going to make yet another FAST-chess player that will play chess using some well-established strategies along with MINIMAX to compute moves for a chess player.  To complete this assignment you have been provided with an abstract base class called chessPlayer and two demo player classes named humanPlayer and autoPlayer. Along with these two class, another class, called gameState, is also provided that holds state of the game at any given time. The state of the chess at any given time consists of information about player turn (i.e. an enumeration called Color with a value of 1 means WHITE player will move and 0 means BLACK player will move) and an 8 x 8 chess board with chess pieces encoded as shown below.
